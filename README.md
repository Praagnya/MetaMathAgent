# MetaMathAgent

MetaMathAgent is a **toy prototype** exploring the architecture of an autonomous multi-agent system. It simulates a system capable of generating problems, reasoning through them, and learning from feedbackâ€”drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning, symbolic reasoning, and cognitive modeling.

> **Note:** This project is a conceptual prototype and is not intended for production use.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The agent comprises modular components that interact to emulate a reasoning process:

- **Problem Generator:** Creates mathematical problems for the agent to solve.
- **Reasoning Agent:** Applies reasoning strategies to tackle generated problems.
- **Feedback Generator:** Provides feedback based on the agent's performance.
- **Episodic Memory:** Stores experiences to inform future reasoning.
- **Integration Controller:** Coordinates interactions among components.
- **Reinforcement Learning System:** Adjusts strategies based on feedback.
